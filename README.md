# node_example_service
Hello! This repository is meant to accompany a Medium blog post, both written as part of a submission for Northeastern University's ENGW3302 English Writing for the Technical Professions course. 

Both this code and the blog post were created collaboratively with Josh Rosenberg. 

# Running the server
